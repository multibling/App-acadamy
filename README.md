This is my first time learning HTML, CSS nad more ... This is whet i picked up while learning.

### Week-1

This is everything done in week 1 around **HTML** mostly, folder *Comp-web* is what was discussed.

#### Concluded

I get the gist of HTML but i think i have to use it more to overly grasp it, the template of the file i 
understand but i need more to chew on.


### Week-2

The *Superhero* app is we did for the week ... 

#### Concluded

CSS is not bad but i feel like it is a bit tricky mostle on the naming and meturements
of it all.  For me to see the light i have to get the understanding of those.


### Week-3



#### Concluded
